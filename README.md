# Accelerated computing with CUDA in Python
In this we will be looking at some basic commands for programming in CUDA for creating acceleratied appliccation. So lets see what is cuda.
 CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model that enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the GPU.
